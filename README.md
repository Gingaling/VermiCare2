# VermiCare2
VermiCare2 is a contemporary and whimsical take on the classic handheld digital pet Tamagotchi, popular in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Do you have what it takes to raise your pet, right?

USER STORIES<br>
"I want to have several pets to choose to ensure I find a companion I can grow attached to."<br>
"I want there to be some level of dynamism or personality from my pet so caring for her isn't just a chore or burden."<br>
"I want the design to be clean and well laid out to make it easy to play and navigate."<br>
"I want any animation to be unique and fun to maintain a user's interest."<br>
"I want interesting statistics to be kept, if possible, concerning the pet's care."<br>

My effort at wire-framing.

BACKGROUND
The genesis of this game was as a project deliverable with General Assembly's (GA) Software Engineering Immersive Program. It was the first sigificant project assigned to the cohort.

The project tested student's understanding of object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation. It also required a decent understanding of CSS to implment the GA requirements for it to be  minimum viable product.

Based on the children's handheld digital toy - the Tamagotchi - I was required to similarly develop a game involving the user's care of a pet or avatar. In my case, I chose worms (dovetailing with my interest in worm composting (vermicomposting)).

The projected was completed with Javascript, JSQuery, CSS, HTML, and an animation stylesheet from animate.css.

There are no special installation requirements. It is self-contained and deployed at a githib-hosted server. While it does need additional work before it becomes a suitable part of a portfolio, basic functionality is there. One noticeable charactersistic, however, is the use of an ordinary prompt that retrieves the user's name choice for their pet worm as well as initiates the game.
