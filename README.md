# RVermiCare2
VermiCare2 is a contemporary and whimsical take on the classic handheld digital pet Tamagotchi, popular in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Do you have what it takes to raise your pet, right?

USER STORIES<br>
"I want to have several pets to choose to ensure I find a companion I can grow attached to."<br>
"I want there to be some level of dynamism or personality from my pet so caring for her isn't just a chore or burden."<br>
"I want the design to be clean and well laid out to make it easy to play and navigate."<br>
"I want any animation to be unique and fun to maintain a user's interest."<br>
"I want interesting statistics to be kept, if possible, concerning the pet's care."<br>

My effort at wire-framing.
